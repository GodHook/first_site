            <p>pikachu,neon,Hook,Silver,Damiar. My family birds in qatar. My family donkey Overseas,Silver family cat. Pikachu and his siblings  prefers to spend their days  relaxing. they are Chirping wildly and flying around in the house. Very social birds love when people hold them, put your hand out so they can fly to your palm.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Pikachu suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
